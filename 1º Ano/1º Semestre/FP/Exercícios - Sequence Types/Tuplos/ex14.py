Write a Python program to reverse a tuple.

# Create a tuple containing a single string
x = ("w3resource")

# Reverse the characters in the string by using the 'reversed' function,
# and then convert the reversed object back into a tuple and print it.
y = reversed(x)
print(tuple(y))

# Create another tuple containing a sequence of numbers
x = (5, 10, 15, 20)

# Reverse the order of the elements in the tuple using the 'reversed' function,
# and then convert the reversed object back into a tuple and print it.
y = reversed(x)
print(tuple(y))
