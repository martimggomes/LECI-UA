 Write a Python program to find the index of an item in a tuple.

# Create a tuple by converting the string "index tuple" into a tuple
tuplex = tuple("index tuple")
# Print the contents of the 'tuplex' tuple
print(tuplex)

# Get the index of the first occurrence of the character "p" in the 'tuplex' tuple
index = tuplex.index("p")
# Print the index value
print(index)

# Define the index from which you want to start searching for the character "p" (index 5)
index = tuplex.index("p", 5)
# Print the index value
print(index)

# Define a segment of the 'tuplex' tuple (from index 3 to 6) within which you want to search for the character "e"
index = tuplex.index("e", 3, 6)
# Print the index value
print(index)

# Attempt to find the index of the character "y," which does not exist in the 'tuplex' tuple
# This will raise a "ValueError" exception because the item is not in the tuple
index = tuplex.index("y")
